# A-Medical-image-annotation-job-using-Appen-Platform
Build a product that helps doctors quickly identify cases of pneumonia in children.
Build a classification system that

* Can help flag serious cases.
* Quickly identify healthy cases.
* And, generally, act as a diagnostic aid for doctors.

As such, this project is designed to test your ability to build a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product. The main task will be to create a data labeling job using Appen's platform
